  <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
  <h1> Title: UX/UI Interactive Filtering Web Application   </h1>
  <h2> Ideal: An interactive web map which allows users to intuitively explore prescribed burns in the NCC's parcels in the Rice Lake Plains over a 15-year period. </h2>
  <h2> Reality: No website currently exists, and spatial data is inaccessible to the public, so there is no way to engage the community of the Rice Lake Plains to learn about past prescribed burns. A proof of concept (with existing data from wildfires in Alberta) will be created until the validity of our data can be confirmed and security issues are resolved.</h2> 
  <h2> Consequences: Without this web application, the Nature Conservancy of Canada would not have the ability to effectively communicate prescribed burn activities to the public and their stakeholders.</h2> 
  <h2> Proposal: Create a proof of concept web application that features an interactive filter to show the wildfires of Alberta by year over a 10-year period.  This proof of concept will be used to design an interactive filter to show the Nature Conservancy of Canada’s burned areas by year and by parcel after security issues are resolved.</h2>
