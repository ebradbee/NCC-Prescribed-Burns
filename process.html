  <h1> Problem Statement</h1>
  <h1> Title: UX/UI Time Series Web Application </h1>
  <h2> Ideal: An interactive web map which allows users to intuitively explore the history of prescribed burns in the Rice Lake Plains.</h2>
  <h2> Reality: No website currently exists and spatial data is inaccessible to the public, so there is no way to engage the community of the Rice Lake Plains to learn about past prescribed burns. A proof of concept (with our data) will be created until the validity of our data can be confirmed.</h2> 
  <h2> Consequences: Without this web application, the Nature Conservancy of Canada would not have the ability to effectively communicate prescribed burn activities to the public and their stakeholders. </h2> 
  <h2> Proposal: Create a web application that features an interactive time series of the Nature Conservancy of Canadaâ€™s prescribed burned sites by year. </h2> 
</div>
<div class="white_main">
  <h1> Changes to the Problem Statement </h1>
  <h2> Originally, we had the idea to create a web application that presented prescribed burn data using an interactive time-lapse function. The wording was changed to "an interactive time series" to facilitate a greater scope of potential web applications. </h2> 
  <h2> Publically available data (Alberta's wildfire data) was used to present a proof of concept because of known data security issues with The Nature Conservancy of Canada's data. </h2>
  <h2> We switched to focus on the user experience and user interface as a way to engage the NCC and the Rice Lake Plains community in future with an application based on the proof of concept after all security issues are addressed. </h2>

    <h8> Step 2 </h8>
  </a>
  <h1> Research Possible Solutions </h1>
  <h2> <b> I. JavaScript API: Filter a Feature Layer <b>  </h2> 
  <h2> Advantages: Uses ESRI products (preferred by client), server-side and client-side filter available to configure, Can display parcel and prescribed burn sites by year, easy for user to filter by year, map can be integrated within a website, host online or run on separate server, and can add additional add-ons to the application (like the TimeSlider) </h2>
  <h2> Disadvantage: Does not provide a simplified view of temporal data </h2> 
  <h2> <b> II. JavaScript API: TimeSlider <b> </h2>
  <h2> Advantages: Uses ESRI products (preferred by client), an interactive graphic used to display temporal data, and host online or run on separate server </h2> 
  <h2> Disadvantage: May not be very useful for the user to quickly find data on a specific year </h2>
  <h2> <b> III. Geocortex: Toolbar with bookmarks, filter, and query functionality <b> </h2>
  <h2> Advantages: High application functionality with toolbars, can perform queries to find specific year and parcel information, can easily explore all the layers from the sidebar, and a lot of options in terms of add-ons (time slider available) </h2>
  <h2> Disadvantages: Geocortex Essentials technology runs on top of ESRI products and the client does not want to use Geocortex </h2>
  <h2> <b> IV. Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS: Time slider widget <b> </h2>
  <h2> Advantages: No coding required, ready-to-use time slider widget available, uses ESRI products (preferred by client), and host online or run on separate server </h2>
  <h2> Disadvantage: No coding means limited flexibility on application style and content </h2>

  </a>
  <h1> Build Solutions/Continue to Research and Troubleshoot </h1>
  <h2> Found Additional Solutions: </h2>
  <h2> <b> V. Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS: Group Filter Widget <b> </h2>
  <h2> Advantages: No coding required, ready-to-use group filter widget available, uses ESRI products (preferred by client), host online or run on seperate server, ability to apply filter on one or more layers within the same map </h2> 
  <h2> Disadvantage: Limited flexibility on application style and content, will require code reworking to filter the parcel name and year </h2>
  <h2> <b> VI. JavaScript API: Query a Feature Layer <b> </h2>
  <h2> Advantages: Uses ESRI products (preferred by client), Server-side and client-side filter available, potentiall could display parcel and prescribed burn sites by year, easy for user to filter by year, map can be integrated within a website, host online or run on seperate server, can add additonal add-ons to the application </h2> 
  <h2> Disadvantage: Does not provide dropdown functionality, does not provide a simplified view of spatial data (like a time-slider) </h2>
  <h1> Our Final Decision: USE THE JAVASCRIPT API: FILTER A FEATURE LAYER </h1>
  <h2> Explanation: This solution gives a dropdown option to the user to choose the year that they are looking for. This adds user functionality that does not exist with time-slider solutions. With additional configurement, there may be a possibilty to write SQL expressions that filter the PB sites by year AND by parcel name. This is the utlimate goal for the web application because this is what the end-user has expressed as their need. The ability to code for additional features (like pop-ups) gives this option an added boost above the rest. </h2>

    <h8> Problems </h8>
  </a>
  <h2> Outcomes: We have decided that our project will become a PROOF OF CONCEPT only. Instead of using the NCC's data, we will use Alberta's wildfire data in our web application. </h2> 
  <h2> This is due to security issues regarding publically hosting the NCC's prescribed burn and the MNRF's parcel data online. </h2> 
  <h2> To solve the security issue, we will need to use a utility service that can only be created with a data server. </h2>
  <h2> We do not have access to a server at this point; therefore, we are creating a proof of concept to show our JavaScript abilities and to explore our UX/UI goals. </h2>
  <h2> Moving Forward: Ten years of the Alberta wildfire data will be downloaded and used as a proof of concept for the filter application, which will identify fires by year from 2009-2019.  This obviates the problem of data security and allows us to demonstrate a working filter application. </h2>

    <h8> Next Steps </h8>
  </a>
  <h2> Proof of Concept: Using the Alberta wildfire data, we were are able to demonstrate that an interactive filter is a feasible design for the larger NCC project. </h2>
  <h2> Conclusion: With a successful proof of concept, we can move forward on the NCC project by addressing the security issues during subsequent weeks.  </h2>
  <h2> Potential Solutions: Create a utility service, and/or create a cached web service for our parcel data, and create hosted feature layer views for our prescribed burn layers </h2> 
  <h2> Additonal WebApp Configurations: Continue to research how to filter prescribed burn sites by year AND by parcel using the JavaScript API solution. </h2>
